<p ALIGN="left">This document contains information about the Sentinel System Driver
installation on Windows 32-bit platforms. We discuss the various installation methods
based on Windows Installer, including the one that use merge modules to seamlessly
integrate driver installation into your own product installation.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="left"><font color="#8080FF"><strong><em>Note for Developers Not Using Windows
Installer!</em></strong></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="left"><em>If you are not using Windows Installer for the Sentinel System Driver
installation, then you must use the old installer program available in the </em>\Windows
32-bit\Legacy<em> directory. There are, however, some limitations to using the older
installer. For example, the old installer does not support installing just the USB driver,
but requires you to install the parallel port driver as well. Also, the legacy installer
does not properly upgrade the USB driver on Windows 2000. If you use the legacy installer
to install the driver over a previous installation on Windows 2000, you will have to
manually update the USB driver through the <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</em> <em>See
the </em>readme.pdf<em> file</em> <em>included in the directory for details on the
installation options.</em></p>
